			<h1>Welcome to our Project</h1>
				<!--<p class="team">We developed this website to serve the purposes of the course work visualizing data.
					 In this work we have chosen to deal with the Greek national health system and through the visualization of the data we can conclude some conclusions.</p>
				<p class="team">We analyzed healthcare data about population, and more specific about the reasons which affect the citizens health like cancer, smoking, accidents etc.
					 We visualized interesting statistics and this is the first step which could lead to scientific conclusions.	 </p> -->

      <h1> Who we are </h1>
      <p> The team consists of two data analyst and one developer who are postgraduate students of DSIT & ICT programs at Kapodistrian University of Athens.
				Both programs awards Masters of Science (M.Sc) degrees and the  course "Data Visualization" gave us the possibility
				 to learn different techniques for turning numbers into informative and interactive images.
</p><br>

        <p><strong> Why?</strong><br>
				We developed this website to present health data in a more comprehensive way, in other words through  visualizations
				 of existing data in files and reports.
						 </p><br>

        <p><strong> What we did?</strong><br>
        Our team analyzed healthcare data and more specifically, the reasons that affected  citizens’ health such as cancer, smoking, accidents etc.
				We visualized interesting statistics and this is the first step which could lead to scientific conclusions.
				Additionally, we collected data  from the Hellenic Statistical Authority’s and Gapminder.org, available in their respective website,
				  and through the visualization of the data we tried to make a story out of a number.</p><br>
					  <p><strong> Our Concept</strong><br>
         We believe, it is very important how to present your data because we live in an inherently visual world, where images speak louder than words.
            </p><br>
